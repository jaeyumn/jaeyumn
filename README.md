<!-- introduce -->
안녕하세요 👋

I'm a junior developer, and very interested in developing user-oriented services through communication with users.

I listen to and accept other people's opinions and advice. I veiw critical perspectives as oppurtunities for improvement, and through feedback, I look for directions in which I can grow.

I'm looking forward to spending quality time interacting with developers from around the world.

Thanks for stopping by!
